# -The-Dimensional-Forest
I love the blend on the colors. :)
I attempted to apply the same blending technique from my previous abstract art to the donkey drawing and then added a tree on top of the blend. Unfortunately, the paint underneath wasn't dry yet, which caused it to smudge while I was drawing the tree.
